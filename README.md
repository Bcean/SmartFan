## Smart Fan

This project features a Smart Fan system built using an STM32 microcontroller. The fan intelligently activates when the room temperature crosses a specific threshold, improving power efficiency and user comfort. The fan can also sweep 180 degrees to cover a broader area.

### Features
- Temperature-based activation using a thermistor and STM32 ADC

- Bidirectional fan control via H-Bridge for user customization

- Servo motor sweep using PWM for automated 180-degree rotation

- Live temperature monitoring via UART to a serial terminal (e.g., TeraTerm or PuTTY)

- Firmware written in C using STM32CubeIDE and HAL libraries

- Designed for easy future firmware updates and feature expansion
