## Smart Fan

The **Smart Fan** is a temperature-activated fan system built using an STM32 microcontroller. It reads temperature data via a sensor and activates a fan when the temperature exceeds a certain threshold. The temperature and fan status are displayed via UART on the computer through the serial port. The system is designed to be modular for future expansions, such as LCD integration and custom modes.

### Features
- Reads real-time temperature via a DHT11 sensor
- Uses PWM to control fan speed
- UART serial output displays temperature and fan status
- Modular code for easy feature expansion (e.g., LCD screen, modes)
- Actively maintained firmware
